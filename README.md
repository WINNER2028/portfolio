# PORTFOLIO
FRONTEND SPECIALIZATION PROJECT

The aim of the project is to create a visual representation of educatonal qualifications, skills, expertise, and capabilities and work experience as a frontend/backend engineer, civil engineer, architect and so on, sortof like an digital resume. It allows you to demonstrate your proficiency in various technologies, and design principles.

INSPIRATION
Early last year I went for an interview and when I
submitted my file, the interviewer asked me if I
had like a digitalized form of what I have in my file
I told her that I don't she looked a bit disappointed
but still carried on with the interview. I didn’t get
that particular job but since then I have always
said to myself why not create a virtual
representation of your resume in that way
potential clients can see what the Engineer is
made off during their vetting process.

Technologies and Architecture Used

HTML5 (Hypertext Markup Language 5) is the
latest version of the HTML standard, the markup
language used to structure content on the web.

CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets 3) is the latest version
of the CSS standard, used for styling and formatting
the visual presentation of web pages. It introduces a
variety of new features, enhancements.

JavaScript and Bootstrap are two essential tools for
web development, each serving a different purpose
but often used together to create dynamic and
responsive user interfaces.
